#### **Correlations & Impact Analysis**
* **Correlation Matrix:** A heatmap shows the correlation between all numerical variables, helping to identify strong positive or negative relationships. * **Heart Rate by Age:** A line chart compares the average BPM per age group for both male and female members, highlighting how heart rate changes with age.
* **Impact on Calories Burned:** Bar charts and column charts analyze how calories burned are impacted by:
    * **Water Intake:** Comparing average calories burned across different water intake groups.
    * **Workout Frequency:** Showing how different workout frequencies (days/week) correlate with average calories burned.
    * **Weight Group:** Analyzing the average calories burned across different weight ranges.
* **BMI and Body Fat:** A bar chart explores the relationship between **Body Fat Percentage** and **BMI Group**, broken down by gender.
